J6 is a chord player oscillator and sequencer.

This oscillator is inspired by the Roland J-6 synthesizer, so you can check it out to understand the concept behind this oscillator.

Each note plays a different chord, from C to B. Parameter 1 “CHRD” (chord) changes the chord set, and there are 100 different chord sets. These are the same as the Roland J-6 chord sets, that can be found at: https://static.roland.com/manuals/J-6_manual_v102/eng/28645807.html

Note: you can access the Parameters 1 to 6 by long pressing the OSC button and turning the TYPE knob.

### Waveforms:

Since the Roland J-6 sounds are based on the Juno-60, I try to recreate the possible waveforms here (as possible).

Use the SHAPE knob to change the waveform:
- At 0 value it is a pure Saw
- Turning it up to 1/4 adds a Pulse (square) wave
- Turning it up to 1/2 adds a Pulse suboscillator (1 octave down)
- Turning it up to 3/4 removes the Saw (remains the pulse normal and suboscillator)
- Turning it up to max removes the suboscillator (remains a single pulse wave)

The shape LFO built-in on the NTS-1 will add PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to the Pulse waves (normal and suboscillator).

### Playing patterns:

Parameter 2 “PATT” (pattern) changes the playing pattern. To use the playing pattern you should turn the arpeggiator on, in latch mode, and set it to play a single a note. This is not mandatory, but that’s how you get the most of the playing patterns. To do this, do the following:
Press ARP button (long press) and turn knob A all the way down. If you long press ARP button you also activate Latch.

You can now change parameter 2 to any of the 100 different playing patterns.

Pattern 1 always play the corresponding chord.
IMPORTANT: always use pattern 1 to play normally without the ARP or to record step sequences, otherwise it might become confusing.

The list of patterns may change in future updates. If you have suggestions for better patterns please send them to me, so I can include them in future updates. 

Patterns 2 to 39 are chord rhythmic patterns: the playing chord will play in certain rhythms.
Patterns 40 to 74 are arpeggiator patterns: notes of the playing chord will be arpeggiated in different sequences, with or without muted steps.
Patterns 75 to 100 are mixed patterns: a mix of chord and arpeggios. 

Check all the patterns at the end of this manual.

### ALT Parameter:

Use the ALT parameter to dynamically change the current playing pattern by adding notes to silent steps, until there are no silent steps on the playing pattern. This works best on arp or mixed patterns. Of course, this only works on patterns with silent steps in the first place.

### Transpose:

Parameter 3 “TRAN” (transpose) will transpose the playing chord up or down, in semitones, and up to + ou – 4 octaves.

### Step sequencer:

You can check how the step sequencer works in detail on the “Volca Bass” OSC video: https://youtu.be/wE8cbGawHDo?t=422

Parameter 4 “MODE–SEQNCR” (Sequencer Mode) controls the step sequencer state
(off, play, record, step record). Values 0-17. This works as follows:
- Value 0 -- sequencer is off, notes played are played in the synth normally.
- Value 17 -- record mode. To start recording: turn this parameter to value 17. Then play 16 notes, those will be recorded in the slot previously selected (see parameter 5).
- Once you record 16 notes, it will automatically enter play mode.
- If you turn it to 0, and then to 17 again, it will enter record mode again, starting at step 1.
- If you turn it to 0, and then to any value between 1 and 16, it will enter play mode.
- In play mode, when you play the synth on the ribbon, all notes played are “ignored” and the notes of the selected sequencer will be played. So all you have to do is turn the ARP on, Latch on, and it will play the sequencer.

Parameter 5 “SLOT-SEQNCR” (Sequencer Slot) selects de sequencer slot. There are 8 slots. If sequencer is off, has no effect. If sequencer is recording, selects the slot for recording. If sequencer is playing, selects the sequencer to play.

Step record: Once in record mode you can turn parameter 4 to any value between 1 and 16 (for instance 5) and the next note you’ll play will overwrite step 5. At this point it won't advance steps automatically. This means that each note you play will overwrite step 5 over and over again until you manually change to other step, or turn it to 0, to stop recording. 

Recording rests: there are two ways to record a rest:
1. Record notes step by step, and the steps you don’t record will be rests
2. Long press any note for more than one second, and it will record a rest (instead of that note)

Parameter 6 “STEP LENGTH–SEQNCR” (Sequencer Step Length) selects the step length (1 to 16) of the sequencer. Each sequencer slot can have it’s own step length. A step length of 2 means ecah step will be played twice, 3 plays every step 3 times, and so on. So imagine you record chord C on step 1 and chord G on step 2, and set the step length to 16, chord C will be played 16 times, and chord G will be played 16 times. If you set a playing pattern, you will have chord C playing a full bar, then chord G playing a full bar as well.


A few extra notes:
- I plan on adding other waveforms in future updates.
- ALT parameter has no effect (for now).
- Shape LFO has no effect (for now).
- Send me patterns you would like me to add in future updates (Direct Message me on twitter)

Please let me know what you think and give any suggestions you like.

Enjoy!
